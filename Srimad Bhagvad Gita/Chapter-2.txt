CHAPTER-2: (Sankhyayoga) 

(The note contains commentary by Swami Sarvapriyananda (and the commentaries he used), Swami Shri Adgadanand Ji, and other sources like Acharya Prashant)


Verse 2:
  -> Chapter-2, Sloka 2 is probably one the most important slokas because no one can help you change or know yourself unless you take the first step, unless you decide to do so.


Verse 11:
  -> Pandit is the one who has 'Panda'. 'Panda' means knowing your true self.
  -> Sri Krishna starts with the highest philosophy. He indirectly points at the essence of knowledge - the importance of knowing about our true self


Verse 12:
  -> Sri Krishna uses negation to emphasis on our mortality (Our true self always exists)
  -> Saying - "We think we are human beings in search of spiritual experience but the truth is we are spiritual beings in search of human experience"


Verse 13:
  -> Shri Krishna now emphasis on Jivatma.
  -> Jivatma is a metaphor to explain the distinction between the two - our true self & our ignorance. Jeevatma is the aparent self - A layer of ignorance.
  -> Shri Krishna says that just as the Jivatma experiences all stages of life, after death it will surely assume another body.

  The subtle body is often described in terms of several layers or sheaths, known as "koshas" in Sanskrit. The most commonly mentioned koshas are:

  1.Annamaya Kosha (Physical Sheath): This is the physical body, which is composed of the elements of food. It is the gross, material aspect of the human being.

  2.Pranamaya Kosha (Vital Energy Sheath): This sheath is associated with the life force or prana, which is the vital energy that sustains the body. It includes the breath and the various     energy channels (nadis) through which prana flows.

  3.Manomaya Kosha (Mental Sheath): This sheath is related to the mind and emotions. It encompasses thoughts, feelings, and mental processes.

  4.Vijnanamaya Kosha (Intellectual Sheath): This sheath is associated with intellect, wisdom, and discernment. It is linked to higher cognitive functions and understanding.

  5.Anandamaya Kosha (Bliss Sheath): This sheath is considered the innermost layer and is associated with a sense of bliss, joy, and spiritual awareness. It is often seen as the connection     to the divine or the ultimate reality.


Verse 14:
  -> All experiences are transient, therefore bear with them. Neither resist nor cling to them.


Verse 16:
  -> Three categories:
       - The one which is the absolute truth (Brahm)
       - The one which is absolute false 
       - The one which borrows from truth 

      for example: The clay pot borrows its existence from the clay. It has no intrinsic property. That which borrows it's existence from the truth has creation & destruction,
                   and is not permanent.
 
      Everything we see or observe has borrowed it's existence from the absolute truth that is why it is called 'MAYA'. God alone is the truth

  -> continuous "isness" - continuous experience of existence ('Satt')
  -> Consciousness or absolute reality exists even if all entities or creation isn't there but to express itself we need objects. The experience disappears when all objects disappear but      existence remains as it is. Brahm is always present 
  -> Waves don't have the water. It's the water which is appearing as waves. A name and form of water is wave.
  -> Brahm is not the creator of universe. The universe was never created. It's your maya which your own self experiences. 
     
     Why Maya? - this isn't a logical question because the answer to this is a cause and there is no cause. Everything started from Maya you can say. Just like there is no question of      'before' before time because 'before' is something related to time itself

  -> The moment you say something 'is' (time is, space is, this is) that 'isness' , first person experience is real that object of experience is just an appearance 


Verse 17:
  -> 'Edum tatam' or 'this that' - Shri Krishna emphahis that everything we experience or we can experience (entire universe) is pervaded by that pure being. 
  -> The light reveals the book. While the presence of book reveals the presence of light. The book manifests light. In the same way, consciousness reveals everything and the abscence or
     presence of anything reveals consisciousness. We can observe the presence of God in every experience.


Verse 18:
  -> Aprameya - not an object to the pramanas which are the instruments of knowledge, which means something which is indefinable.

  (The camera is recording, it is like the camera is "seeing" but does it have a first person experience of seeing?? No. It's not our eyes which sees but the consciousness which
     through the mind and eyes sees everything)

  -> Knower of Brahman is none other than Brahman : ब्रह्मविद् ब्रह्मैव भवति।


Verse 19:
  -> Poem Brahma BY RALPH WALDO EMERSON
  -> Atma is neither the doer (Karta) nor the experiencer of the results of action (bhokta). It is the ego which is limited by the body and the mind, considers itself to be both 
     the doer and experiencer of the actions. It gets trapped in Karma


Verse 22:
  -> Birth and death are nothing but exchange of bodies. But this happens at a higher level (cycle of nature), not individual level. Just likes waves in an ocean. There are no personal           waves. (AP)
  -> Ego again regenerates (Ahm Virti) (AP)

  -> In Hindu philosophy, particularly in Vedanta and Yoga, the concept of the three bodies refers to different aspects or layers of the human being. These three bodies are:

      1. Sthula Sharira (Gross Body):

         Sthula Sharira refers to the physical body, which is composed of the five elements: earth, water, fire, air, and ether. It is the tangible, visible aspect of the human being that          we can perceive with our senses.

      2. Sukshma Sharira (Subtle Body):

         Sukshma Sharira is the subtle body, which is not perceivable by the physical senses. It consists of the mind (manas), intellect (buddhi), ego (ahamkara), and the vital energy          (prana). This body is responsible for thoughts, emotions, desires, and the functioning of the mind.

      3. Karana Sharira (Causal Body):

         Karana Sharira is the causal body, also known as the "causal sheath" or "seed body." It is the deepest layer of existence and represents the cause of individual existence. It          contains the seeds of all karmas (actions) and impressions from past lives, which shape one's present life and future experiences. It's just the first covering of ignorance 
         over our real nature.

  -> When we die, it's the physical body which dies. The subtle body finds another body. The real you, pure consciousness, never comes and goes. You are none of the three bodies.
     Because of our ignorance, we identify ourselves with the subtle body. Atman identified with the subtle body is called 'Jiva'. This Jiva takes rebirth in various physical bodies. 

  -> At Moksha, the subtle body dissolves but due to past karmas, it continues to stay for sometimes. Those are called enlightened beings.


Verse 23:

  -> The 5  elements -space, fire, water, land, wind - donot affect Atman.

  -> Cause to effect: creation (water to waves)
  -> Effect to cause: destruction (waves to water)

  Note that effect can never destroy its cause. (waves can never destroy water)


Verse 25:
   -> Atman is not an object. Pramanas don't reveal it but all pramanas work in its light.
   -> Anubhava matram (minus the object) parambrahma 


Verse 26:
   -> Sri Krishna is taking a different stance now. He is coming a few steps down.

   
Verse 27:
   -> Sri Krishna Arjun ko vaktigat ahankar se mukt kar rahe


Verse 29:
   -> To know something there are three elements involved - knower (gyata), object to be known (gyaya) & intruments of knowledge (gyana) like senses, mind intellect etc.
      All 3 of these isn't applicable to Atma. "It reveals or knows itself" - Knower of Brahman is none other than Brahman : ब्रह्मविद् ब्रह्मैव भवति। That's why its a mystery.

     example: suppose you are in a dark room and your eyes are closed, there is complete silence, no smell or touch. Can you say whether there is a book in the room or not? - no
              But can you say whether you are there or not, the answer certainly is yes. You just know that you are there.

  -> Only a rare one can know Atma. It requires intense desire for freedom.
  -> Teaching it or explaining it is also a mystery because its beyond words. 
  
  -> Atma is beyond whatever you know. It is also beyond what you don't know. What is that which is neither the known nor the unknown? - it is the knowner

  -> watch the video : The Language of Paradox in Advaita - Swami Sarvapriyanada (youtube)



Verse 30:
  -> See that Krishna uses the phrase 'Yeh Atma' (singular), which means that he points to the fact that 'Atma is one, not many'


Verse 31:
  -> Swadharma means your own dharma - swabhava janita dharma (one born out of one's own nature)
  -> Swabhava of each person is different. Swaroopa of all are the same - Brahman


Verse 32-38:
  -> In these verse, Krishna somehow answers the previous questions of Arjuna
  -> If you do the right thing, whatever be the result, you are the winner
  -> To know what's meaningful in your life, look for what's not meaningful in your life


Verse 39:
  -> Why the transition from Gyana yoga to karma yoga was necessary? - because after listening to all Gyana, we ask "Now what?"
  -> Entire life should be spiritualised. Spirituality should'nt be just a small part of your life.
  -> Karmayoga as a step to or preparation for Gyana yoga (by traditional commentators)
  -> Knowledge removes ignorance provided the object & locus (place) of both are the same.
      Eg. 1. Knowledge of physics can remove the ignorance of physics
          2. Other's knowledge is not enough, you must realise it
  -> Karma Yoga purifies your mind. Dhyana yoga increases your concentration & focus. Gyana Yoga provides knowledge to remove ignorance.
     With a purified mind, meditation is effective and dhyana increases your concentration. So with a focused mind, when you take knowlege of Atma, breakthroughs happen.
     (it's framework of Advaita Vedant)


Verse 41:
  -> One pointed focus or clarity is needed for spiritual progress or moksha. Mind should be directled singly towards one ideal - God realisation or moksha or nirvana or eternal peace
  -> Unwise men have many desires and their mind runs after many goals (wordly goals)
  -> There are many ways to fall but one way to rise. You can get pleasure through many senses but rejecting them all and getting peace is one. You can get angry in many way but making 
     yourself calm and peaceful is one
  -> Detachment from multiple goals or desires & focus on God realisation goes together (Dono saath saath chalte). One can't be done without the other.
  -> You can't have 100 wordly goals and your 101th goal is God realisation
     
    ~ 'Neither seek nor avoid' - Swami Vivekananda


Verse 42-44:
  -> The wordly actions or vedic rituals we do is for our desires or selfish purposes and this again deviates us from Nischayatmika buddhi or doesn't let us focus on God (Truth)
  -> Sri Krishna says that people who think only heaven is the supreme goal and there is nothing beyond heaven are unwise.
  -> A wise person sees a little bit and understands that the rest of the worldly life is like this only.


Verse 45:
  -> Lower Religion - i want to satisfy my needs and desires so religion or God will help me in that
     Higher religion - spiritual seeker: I want nothing but God (truth). Not God for my life but my life for God.
  -> The Karma Kanda of Vedas deals with the three gunas. Gyana kanda is for seeking he higher Truth.
  -> Shri Krishna asks Arjuna to transcend the three gunas.

  -> Why even the vedas deal with wordly desires? 
    
     - This is because we all have desires , we all want many things and if vedas/religion don't tell about some ethical ways to fulfill those materialistic desires then masses
       will go for unethical ways which will lead to extensive sufferings.


Verse 47:
  -> Law of Karma:
       Dharma (consciuously done ethical actions) ----> Punya (merit) ----> Sukha (happiness)
       Adharma (consciuously done inethical actions) ----> Paapa (demerit) ----> Dukha (Sorrow) 
  -> The Three Gunas (including Sattav guna) are materialistic (Jada Prakriti)

  -> Shri Krishna asks Arjuna to follow his Dharma, do what is right and for the greater good (here the battle of Kurukshetra) without getting attached to the fruits of his actions.
  
  -> How can one do something without any motive?
     One Swami ji answered: "Disinterested (without any selfish motives) action not uninterested (lack of personal interest) action"

  -> When the results of actions come, let our attitude be spiritual. When the results are good as per us, let's use that for doing good to others. When the results are bad as per us,
     let's have a spiritual attitude towars that. Ride such waves.

  NOTE:

  1. Our results aren't only dependent on our karma but it depends on a lot of other factors. The farmer may sow the seeds in the field but the rain, sunlight, soil and many other 
     natural factors contribute to to the growth of crops.

  2. Karmayoga requires focus, not a scattered mind.

  3. - Giving up action is Tamasic.
     - Action with desire is Rajasic. The result is bondage and suffering.
     - Action without desire is saatvic.
     
     Do not get attached to the results of these three. Transcend all three gunas.

  4. Karma and Results
     
     -  All my actions from now are for the greater good, in service of the lord, for God realisation.
     -  Every suffering is an opportunity to remember God.

 -> Krishna is asking Arjuna not to attach himself to the results because this desire to experience a pleasant result of our action (bhoktritva) kindles the flame within us to do 
    more such actions to fulfill our wordly desires. This traps us with karma.

 -> 4 things about desires:
      1. When i have a desire, i agree to create a void within me.
      2. I lose my freedom and become a slave.
      3. Unfulfilled desires lead to frustration and suffering.
      4. Desires never end. 

     'Trying to end desires by fulfilling them is like trying to extinguish a fire by adding ghee.'

  -> Serve all beings, knowing them to be God.




Verse 50:
  -> The traditional ritualistic vedic hindu used to perform all good actions (punya) so that he cqan go to heaven after death. Thats lower religion.
  -> Shri Krisha is asking Arjuna to give up this idea of punya and papa and focus on doing the right thing without worrying about results. That is higher religion.
  -> Shri Krishna asks Arjuna to go beyond this religion of risk and reward which is a religion of fear.
  -> Actions that bind you to Samsara, use those same actions to set yourself free. That is yoga or skill in action.

     
Verse 52:
  -> The attachment to body-mind complex, to our own desires is referred to as delusion by the Lord.
  -> Shri Krishna says when one's mind transcends this maze of attachment or this delusion, the person becomes indifferent to what all he has experienced and what all he has to 
     experiences in the future. This means that the person becomes detached from all wordly desires, he doesn't seek any personal pleasure from the external world. 


Verse 55:
  -> To get enlightended, one must deepen their knowledge or wisdom about God (Truth) & truly realize it. From wisdom(pragya) to stabilized wisdom(sthita pragya)
  -> The enlightened person doesn't feel that the inner joy has to be constantly reflected in the mind. Ananada (inner joy) is not an experience (an experience is temporary, it comes and         goes). An experience is just reflection of the reality. Ananda is not a felt experience. Its reflection is felt.


Verse 58:
  -> The senses run towards their objects -  we want to see good, smell good, touch good, taste good and feel good.
  -> Our senses are like an elephant and we are like the rider. The rider can direct the elephant to go somewhere only when the elephant listens to him.
  -> Often we are deluded. Wherever the elephant goes, we think we are making him go but its the reverse
  
  -> Our intellect reads, makes arguements, digests information but who has to do the jo? - certainly not the intellect
  -> The elephant in order to be directed does not need lectures or arguements, it needs training.


Verse 60:
  -> The senses are very powerful.
  -> The senses, if not free from attachment, can forcibly carry away the mind of a wise man also.

  -> A question: Let me enjoy yhe world but my mind will remain unattached from wordly pleasures?
          - This is not possible for a beginner and even very hard for a wise man
  -> That's why Bhakti is very useful in the path of Gyana. It purifies the heart and allows knowledge to have full play.


Verse 62, 63:
  -> We are not rational beings, we are irrational being who try to make some rational decisions.
  -> Three great humiliations of human civilisation:
            1. Copernicus' Heliocentric Theory: we are not the center of the universe
            2. Darwin's theory of evolution -  Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection suggested that humans evolved from common ancestors shared with other primates,                                                rather than being created separately in a divine act.
            3. Logic and reasoning is just the surface of human nature, from within we are filled with ego, anger, lust etc trying to balance the expectations of society. Much of our                behavior is driven by unconscious forces such as ego, anger, lust, and other primal urges.

  -> Yoga has the power to transform our inherent biological nature. We can try our mind to attain the highest.
  
  -> Desire and anger go together.

  -> All the practices we do, keep a component of happiness involved there. Don't make it completely miserable.
         Swami Smaranananda ji : " The goal is bliss. The means to must be blissful"


Verse 64:
  -> Control over the senses, making them disciplined, enables a yogi to enjoy interact with the world and he attains placidity (a calm or peaceful quality) of mind.
  -> Be in the middle for worldly things. Don't become too happy when something pleasant happens, and don't become too sad when something unpleasant happens.
  
  -> Restlessness about the divine takes you to the divine.
  -> Restlessness or delight melts your inner being, making it easier to impress upon. That's why you shouldn't waste your restlessness on worldly things. Direct it towards the divine.


Verse 65:
  -> Attaining placidity of mind removes all sorrow and the Karmayogi is then able to firmly establish his intellect in God.
  -> Disturbances are manifold. Anger, sadness, greed, and envy are all different, but peace in their absence is the same. 


Verse 66:
  -> Lack of control over senses ---> no contemplation (an act of considering with attention) ---> no peace ---> no happiness


Verse 67:
  -> The winds easily carry away a boat upon the water; similarly, a mind moving towards a particular sense object is easily carried away by that sense. 
  -> Note that a boat on shore isn't easily carried away by the winds; similarly, a mind free from attachment to sense objects isn't easily carried away by the senses.


Verse 70:
  -> When all enjoyments (rivers of the senses) pour into the mind of the enlightened person, it remains undisturbed because his mind is like a vast ocean: serene, calm, and under control,      an ocean which does not get disturbed by the river waters entering it.
  -> Note that the enlightened person here is not shutting himself off from the world. He is quite active but still isn't dependent on (has no attachment to) the world. He is like the vast,      serene ocean.

Verse 71:
  -> Free from egoism means free from "I"
  -> Ego is a function of the mind.

Verse 72:
  -> Spiritual journey is not a journey in space from one place to another, nor a journey in time, nor from one thing to another. It's a journey from ignorance to knowledge, from non-     realization to realization.
  -> After I attain enlightenment, will I return to samsara by any chance? Shri Krishna says no. One who attains Brahmi Sthiti overcomes attachment and delusion and becomes established in      that state. They attain supreme bliss.
  -> Ignorance is beginningless. Something which is beginningless cannot ever begin. Therefore, ignorance can never return.

GENERAL NOTES:
  

1. Swadharma - Aatma hin dharm hai lekin ustak jaaneki samta sabh mai alag alag hoti hai. Sabka alag jivan hai aur swabhav hai. Isiko swadharm kehte hain. Gives rise to four varnas (chapter-2, sloka 31, 49.00 )

2. Kshetra (क्षेत्र): This term refers to the "field" or the physical body. It represents the material aspect of existence.

   Kshetrajna (क्षेत्रज्ञ): This term refers to the "knower of the field" or the soul, the conscious self that inhabits the body. It represents the spiritual aspect of existence.

3. Gyana Yoga and Karma Yoga are not different for Shree Krishna. Dono mai karm saman karna padta hai bas dhristikon alag hojata hai. Gyana yoga mai yogi apni sthithi ko samajh kar apne upar nirbhar hokar karm karta hai jabki karma yogi apne ishta par asshrit hokar karm karta hai ( chapter-2, sloka 39, 1.05)

4. Yogah Karmasu Kaushalam - Samatya roop hin yog hai aur yahi karma mai kushalta hai, yehi karma mai shresthata hai  (chapter-2, sloka 50)

5. Subh woh jo parmaatma ki aur lejaaye aur Asubh woh jo pakriti ki aur lejaaye (chapter-2, sloka 57)

6. Bina Istha chintan ke mann ko sthir karna mushkil hai, kyunki bina Istha chintan ke mann mai baaki visyon ka khayal aayega aur aasakti bahdegi (chapter-2, sloka 61, 1.38.35)

7. Chapter-2, sloka 72, 1.52.05 - Brahmi Sthithi

8. A Aryan (noble person) is one who does the right thing just because it is right
11. Three types of sorrow:
    Adhyatmika - suffering because of the self (ego)
    Aadibhautika - suffering with comes from other beings
    Aadidavika - natural sufferings

12. It's important to know that wordly, external problems are neither permanent nor certain.

13. Take good care of the body and the mind. Don't torture the horse you can't dismount.

14. Swami Vivekananda's definition of:
    humility - one who sees the greatness in others
    patience - one who has 'strength' and strength means not reacting for a long time
    
15. In the book, The Imitation of Christ - The writer writes about a convo between Jesus Christ & his disciple where the disciple asks the Lord 'How can i get peace?'
    The Lord answers:
                    i> Always seek less, not more
                    ii> Always seek to be last rather than first
                    iii> Always seek to do the will of another rather than your own
                     iv> In all things, learn to accept the will of God

16. Knower of Brahman is none other than Brahman

17. Hard problem of matter : We all are conscious, all matter appears to us in  consciousness and we try to investigate it. And the more we try to investigate it, it keeps on disappears.
    Atoms -> nucleons -> quarks. We are just getting names and forms

18. We are not human being seeking spiritual experience, rather we are spiritual beings having a human experience

19. Braham and Atman are the same. (Absolute convergence)

20. "Each sould is potentially divine and the goal is to manifest this divinity already within us. Do it my meditation, do it by service, do it by knowledge, do it by love, any or 
      all of these and be free. Books, temples, doctrines and churches are secondary details." - Swami Vivekananda

21. Knowing and realisation are two different things. Knowing has to be deepened into realisation - first person experience. You must honestly able to see this. Just like we, without
    any doubt see ourselves as the body, we must be able to see ourselves as the pure consciousness.

    Vedantic approach:
       1. Shravana: This is the first stage and involves hearing or listening to the teachings of the scriptures from a qualified teacher (Guru). It's about absorbing the knowledge of the                     scriptures and gaining a conceptual understanding of the teachings. The student learns about the nature of reality, the self, and the ultimate truth through studying the                     sacred texts such as the Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, Brahma Sutras, etc.

       2. Manana: Once the knowledge is acquired through Shravana, the next stage is reflection or contemplation. In Manana, the student deeply reflects upon the teachings and critically                   examines them. This involves resolving doubts, clarifying misunderstandings, and intellectually digesting the knowledge gained during the Shravana stage. Through Manana,                   the student ensures that the teachings are coherent and consistent with his or her own understanding and experience.

       3. Nididhyasana: This is the stage of deep meditation or profound contemplation. In Nididhyasana, the seeker focuses intensely on the truths revealed in the scriptures. It goes           beyond mere intellectual understanding and involves internalizing the teachings at a deeper level. The aim of Nididhyasana is to directly experience the truth of one's own nature           and the ultimate reality. It's a process of self-inquiry, where the seeker transcends the limitations of the mind and ego to realize the non-dual nature of existence.

22. When we die, it's the physical body which dies. The subtle body finds another body. The real you, pure consciousness, never comes and goes. You are none of the three bodies.
     Because of our ignorance, we identify ourselves with the subtle body. Atman identified with the subtle body is called 'Jiva'. This Jiva takes rebirth in various physical bodies. 

23.  -> Cause to effect: creation (water to waves)
  -> Effect to cause: destruction (waves to water)

  Note that effect can never destroy its cause. (waves can never destroy water)

24. Transcend from the materail world instead of hoping for a better material world.

25. 'Freewill' is a contradiction in terms. 'Will' is associated with causation, so it can't be free.

26. If everything you do in this world - eating, earning, traveling, dancing etc -  is duality then why can't you accept duality while worshipping God. What wrong did he/she do?

27. Self knowledge is knowledge independent of any instruments of knowledge (senses, mind, intellect).

28. Swadharma means your own dharma - swabhava janita dharma (one born out of one's own nature)
    Swabhava of each person is different. Swaroopa of all are the same - Brahman

29. Seligman’s conclusion is that happiness has three dimensions that can be cultivated: the Pleasant Life (pleasure), the Good Life (engagement), and the Meaningful Life (meaning).

    - Watching a game on television is pleasure but going out and playing is engagement. Engagement gives more statisfaction than pleasure.
    - A higher purpose in life or meaning gives more satisfaction than engagement also.

    Kama, Artha, Dharma, Moksha

30. Knowledge removes ignorance provided the object & locus (place) of both are the same.
      Eg. 1. Knowledge of physics can remove the ignorance of physics
          2. Other's knowledge is not enough, you must realise it

31. One Guru - In Bhakti you say to the supereme Lord that you alone are the truth, How it's different from Advaita?

32. Law of Karma:
       Dharma (consciuously done ethical actions) ----> Punya (merit) ----> Sukha (happiness)
       Adharma (consciuously done inethical actions) ----> Paapa (demerit) ----> Dukha (Sorrow) 

33. Happniess in modern world is like building of tension and releasing it - 
       You make desires and crave to fulfill them and when it gets fulfilled, you call it happiness.

34. The enlightened person doesn't feel that the inner joy has to be constantly reflected in the mind. Ananada (inner joy) is not an experience (an experiences is temporary, it commes and      goes). An experience is an reflection of the reality. Ananda is not a felt experience. Its reflection is felt.

35. Three great humiliations of human civilisation:
            1. Copernicus' Heliocentric Theory: we are not the center of the universe
            2. Darwin's theory of evolution -  Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection suggested that humans evolved from common ancestors shared with other primates,                                                rather than being created separately in a divine act.
            3. Logic and reasoning is just the surface of human nature, from within we are filled with ego, anger, lust etc trying to balance the expectations of society. Much of our                behavior is driven by unconscious forces such as ego, anger, lust, and other primal urges.

36. People whose minds are strongly immersed in wordliness, you cannot depend on such people because they ae guided by forces beyond their control.

37. If this is true, what else matters? If this is not true, what else matters?
