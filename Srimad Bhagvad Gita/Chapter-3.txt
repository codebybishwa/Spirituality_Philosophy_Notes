Chapter-3: Karmayoga

[The note contains commentary by Swami Sarvapriyananda (and the commentaries he used such as those of Madhusūdana Sarasvatī), Swami Shri Adgadanand Ji, and other sources like Acharya  Prashant] (If not mentioned explicitly, then the note is taken from Swami Sarvapriyananda's lectures)

Verse 1:
  -> Arjuna considers Gyana Yoga to be separate from Karma Yoga, viewing them as two distinct choices (options).
  -> But they are two necessary requirements in sequence in the spiritual journey. Karma Yoga is essential to purify the mind so that one can progress on the path of Gyana.
  -> Shri Krishna emphasizes that you shouldn't run away from what life throws at you. Whatever necessary action is required, do it to purify your mind for spiritual progress.

  -> Janardan - the name signifies Vishnu's role in protecting his devotees by destroying evil and maintaining cosmic order.

  -> What does purifying the mind mean?

     Our minds have deep conditioning accumulated over ages. There is both biological and social conditioning. It is easy to think of things you desire and even easier to think of things      you fear. The mind needs to be set free from these conditionings, these waves of desires.


Verse 3:
  -> Those who are set for knowledge proceed along the path of knowledge - Sankhayogi, whereas those who aren't yet set for it proceed along the path of the action - Karmayogi.


Verse 4:
  -> Shri Krishna emphasizes spiritualizing our actions and duties, which is Karma Yoga. Without that, spiritual progress is impossible.


Verse 5:
  -> Nature is restless.
  -> You can never avoid actions, so channel those actions towards a higher purpose: the service of God and the pursuit of Nirvana.

  -> You certainly have to do actions to surpass the gunas of pakriti.


Verse 6:
  -> What if someone tries to stop all actions?

     Shri Krishna says that he who forcibly tries to restrain the sense organs outwardly and stop actions, but still mentally dwells on the objects of the senses, is nothing but a              hypocrite.
  -> Thinking 'I am Brahman' in the mind while the body and mind are doing something else is called hypocrisy.
  -> Two types of Karmas:

       Kartavya Karma - one's duties and responsibilities.
       Karma which is for the welfare of others and for the greater good.


Verse 7:
  -> 'I am talking' - not true. The body functions — the mouth, tongue, facial muscles, and brain— all coordinate to speak, but the ego associates it with 'I am talking'.
  ->  The ego claims desires that arise in the mind.

  -> The entire body-mind system is not the 'I' (the true self):

     # It changes, I do not change (Sarvikaara - Nirvikaara).
     # It is an object (because you are aware of it) , I am the subject (Dhrishta - Drishya).
     # It is inert, I am conscious (Chit - Jada).
     # It is external, I am internal and subtle (Bahya - Antara).
     # It is composite and many, I am one and individual (Ekam - Anekam).

  -> Taking control of the body means overcoming the body-mind complex and not getting attached to it.


Verse 8:
  -> Action with desire is Rajas, while inaction is Tamas. Even if Rajas is not great, it is still better than Tamas.
     - Higher than inaction is action with desire, and higher than that is action without desire.
      
  -> Even if you give up all duties, your body will still demand action to survive. So, don't make the foolish mistake of trying to give up all actions; instead, do your allotted duty.
  -> Two types of Karmas:

       Kartavya Karma - one's duties and responsibilities.
       Karma which is for the welfare of others and for the greater good.  

  -> Remember, young monks in certain orders aren't free from action or duties. They are made to do a lot of hard work like teaching, taking care of children or sick people, managing tasks,      etc. Initially, they are not spared from action. This is done because young monks don't have their minds ready yet, so they have to perform good actions.


Verse 9:

    (Swami Sarvapriyananda: )

  -> You can't give away actions, and you can't do bad karma. You can do good karma to get benefits out of it, but that too traps you in Samsara.
          
             'Chains ,though of gold, are not less strong to bind' -  Swami Vivekananda

  -> Therefore, Shri Krishna is asking Arjuna to do all actions for the sake of yajna, that is, to perform all actions in worship of the Lord. Make your life a worship of the Lord.
  -> And whatever the results are, whether pleasant or unpleasant, consider them as prasad and accept them with delight.
  -> The entire cosmos is a big yagya (fire ritual) in which you give your offerings and receive the results as prasad.

   (Acharya Prasant: )

  -> Yagya ka arth hai jo bhi hai mere paas (all actions) usko mai aahuti de raha hun apne param lakshya ke prati.
  -> Yagya phir karm nhi maana jaata.
  -> Vedic fire ritual symbolizes this.

   (Swami Shri Adgadanand Ji: )
  
  -> Yajna ke atirikt jo kuch bhi kiya jaata hai woh isi lok ka bandhan hai.


Verse 10:

    (Swami Sarvapriyananda: )

    -> For a long time, many humans used to believe that nature belongs to man and can be exploited. This is a wrong interpretation of scriptures and teachings. We are a part of nature and         responsible towards it.

    (Swami Shri Adgadanand Ji: )

    -> Prajapati - Jisne praja ke mul udgam Parmatma mai pravesh paa liya hai. Buddhi hin Brahma hai.
    -> Wohi mahapurush hin prakriti ke dwand ka vishleshan kar nirdharit kriyaon ki rachna karte hain.
       They are the great men who analyze the duality of nature and create the prescribed actions.
  

Verse 11:

    (Swami Sarvapriyananda: )

   -> Sustain nature and nature will sustain you.

    (Swami Shri Adgadanand Ji: )

  -> The inner qualities that bring one closer to Brahm (truth) are considered divine (Daivi Sampad). Yajna enhances these qualities, leading one to attain the highest good.


Verse 12:

    (Swami Sarvapriyananda: )

  -> The one who exploits nature (Prakriti) without giving back is a thief. Vedic gods are symbolic of nature.

    (Acharya Prashant: )
  
  -> Yajna ka arth hai vah jo tumhe devtaon se jodta hai. Devta maane vah jo uchai par baitha hai.
  -> Toh jivan kya hai? Gita ke anusar jivan yajna hai, jisme tumhe lagatar apni urja ki, samay ki, sabhi sambandhon ki ahuti deni hai.


Verse 13:

   (Acharya Prashant: )
    
  -> Apni urja ko, apne samay ko, apni buddhi ko, apne dhan ko, apne bal ko agar tum yajna mein arpan karne ke bajaye apne saaririk sukh ke liye prayog kar rahe ho, toh tum ann nahin, paap      ko khaa rahe ho.  
     If you are using your energy, time, intellect, wealth, and strength for your physical pleasures instead of dedicating them to the yajna, then you are consuming sin, not food.

Verse 14:
  -> Shri Krishna is asking Arjuna to perform  yagya (not the literal fire ritual), which will result in nature providing abundance.
  -> Earlier, all my actions were karma and their results were karma-phala. Now, all my actions are puja (worship) and their results are prasada.


Verse 15:
   
    (Swami Shri Adgadanand Ji: )
   
  -> The Vedas are apaurushiya (not of human origin). 
  -> Why the vedas originate from Partatma (Brahm) ?
     
     The great men (Rishis) who composed the mantras of the Vedas were seers of the ultimate truth (तत्वदर्शी) and absorbed in Brahman (ब्रह्मलीन).  After their realization, they had only Brahman within      them; hence, the verses of the Vedas originated from Brahman.


Verse 16:

   (Swami Sarvapriyananda: )

  -> The person who acts driven by their own desires or sense pleasures, without caring about the greater good of others (donot perform yagya), lives in vain.
  -> This is because such a person does not attain spiritual liberation. Moreover, worldly pleasures provide dissatisfaction at some point.
  
  -> 5 great sacrifices in hindu scriptures:
        
       1. Brahma Yajna (ब्राह्म यज्ञ):  The study and teaching of the scriptures.
       2. Deva Yajna (देव यज्ञ):  Sacrifices made to the Vedic gods; daily acts of worship to the divine.
       3. Pitru Yajna (पितृ यज्ञ):  Paying homage to and remembering one’s ancestors through rituals and offerings, acknowledging their contribution to our existence.
       4. Nri Yajna (नृ यज्ञ):  Acts of service and care towards fellow human beings.
       5. Bhuta Yajna (भूत यज्ञ):  Showing respect and care for all living beings and the environment, acknowledging the interconnectedness of all life.


   (Acharya Prashant: )
   
   A Beautiful Analogy ~
   Imagine rain falling from the sky onto the trees. Initially, much of the water is received by the leaves, then it trickles down to the ground, where it is absorbed by the soil and then    taken up by the roots. This water, absorbed by the roots, travels to other parts of the tree and eventually returns to the leaves.
   What if one day the leaves collectively decide that they should not give away the abundance of water they are receiving? They might think it is their right to keep it all and refuse to    let it go to the roots. Deluded by their ignorance and misunderstanding of the interconnected processes of nature (the cosmos), they choose to withhold the water from that day forward.    Eventually, very little water reaches the roots, and the entire tree begins to dry up, causing the leaves to die.

   1. The process of letting go of the rainwater by the leaves for the roots, to sustain the entire tree system, represents Yajna for the leaves. This is an example from nature. 
   2. Similarly, for humans, Yajna means sacrificing whatever resources you have for a higher purpose or the greater good, which often demands that the most. Do not hold on to these       resources. 
   3. However, do not give away resources that cannot be used for Yajna and may instead be used for a lower purpose. 


Verse 17:
  -> The Atman is the awareness, the ultimate subject which is unchanging, whereas everything else (which is not something different, just an appearance of pure consciousness) is changing.    -> The Atman is hidden by primal ignorance (Avidya). 
      How are we ignorant? Who is really ignorant?
       - Is it the mind that is ignorant? No, because the mind is an object. Unless you realize Brahman, consider yourself ignorant. Don't try to prove the existence of ignorance; try to          remove it.

      - Avidya causes individuals to identify with their physical body, mind, and ego (collectively referred to as the Jiva) rather than their true self, the Atman.

  -> Samsara, which is ever-changing, can never provide us with lasting satisfaction.

     "All compounded things are subject to decay. Strive with diligence!" ― Gautama Buddha
      
      "All compounded things" - whether physical objects, mental states, or experiences - decay. This highlights the transient and impermanent nature of compounded things.
       This is a fundamental concept in Buddhism known as impermanence (anicca).
       
       Strive with diligence: In light of the impermanent nature of all things, Buddha encourages us to strive diligently. This means putting in constant and dedicated effort towards              spiritual practice and personal growth. Understanding the impermanence of the world should motivate individuals to focus on what truly matters, such as cultivating wisdom, ethical           conduct, and mental discipline.

 -> Such a person who is content in the self has no duty (tasya kārya nivṛttam), and this can imply three things:
       1. Because there are no desires to be fulfilled, there are no more actions to be undertaken to fulfill desires.
       2. Vedanta considers that all actions in the entire cosmos are meant to lead you towards enlightenment.
       3. There is action even after enlightenment. Work is not a duty for them now; that work is an expression of their enlightenment for the well-being of others.


Verse 18: 
  -> Addiction to action is Rajasik, while addiction to inaction or laziness is Tamasik. Action is superior to inaction, but both attitudes have to be transcended: intense action inside,         calmness outside; intense action outside, calmness within.

  -> Pravritti: Engages with the world, sees life as an opportunity to serve and fulfill duties.
     Nivritti: Withdraws from worldly engagements to focus on inner spiritual growth.

  -> Unless you attain Brahman, both Pravritti and Nivritti remain in the domain of action. All actions, including the highest spiritual practices, are in the realm of Maya.

  -> Swami Vivekananda taught that one can achieve spiritual realization through religion, science, or art, but one must understand Advaita to do so.


Verse 19:
  -> If you don't spiritualize your entire life and all your actions and duties, it becomes really hard to make any spiritual progress because the world will make you restless and you won't      have time to do any spiritual practice. That's where the importance of Karmayoga lies.

Verse 20:

   (Swami Sarvapriyananda: )

  -> Both action and inaction are the divine play of consciousness (Chaitanya).
  -> Shankaracharya says that 'perfection' here is the 'purification' of the mind. According to him, knowledge (gyana) alone can enlighten you, and other paths ultimately lead you to the         state where knowledge can set you free.

  (Swami Shri Adgadanand Ji: )

  -> Perfection here means the absolute truth: Brahman.


Verse 21:
  -> Madhusūdana Sarasvatī says Arjuna might have thought, 'Why should I look up to or follow anyone else like Janaka? I can just read and follow what’s written in the scriptures.' The           issue with that is it’s your interpretation of the scriptures, a product of your intellect. How are you so sure that your intellect or mind is better than others, or that you have           more clarity? 
  -> Attachment to intellect may turn out to be wrong for you so be open to learn from others.
  -> Also, beware of false people who may claim to be enlightened. Try to maintain a balance between your own reasoning and the experiences of enlightened beings.


Verse 25:
 -> Whatever work you do, do it without attachment to it. Then why should you work? Do it with the desire to promote the welfare of others, not just for the benefit of your own body and         mind.

Verse 27:
 -> The feeling of "I" which is associated with one body and mind, to which all others are "other," is called 'Ahankara'.
 -> "I" is a function of the mind, and I (the true self or witness consciousness) is the real I.
 -> Pure consciousness is consciousness without any objective constituent, where I am that which is aware of everything but of which you are not aware. It is that which can light up             everything but can never be lit up itself.

 -> The true self (witness consciousness) lights up the mind, and this illuminated mind is what we are experiencing as awareness right now. What we experience as the mind is the mind plus       reflected consciousness. When we look within our mind, we experience many things: emotions, thoughts, desires, feelings, and also awareness.

 -> Ego, with the mind, becomes the knower (Pramata). There is a distinction between the knower and witness consciousness (Sakshi). The knower, together with the organs of action, claims,       "I walk, I talk, I do." The knower now becomes the doer (Karta) and, by taking all inputs from the world, becomes the experiencer (Bhokta).
    None of these are the real you but activities of the ego.

 -> Sakshi never changes, but ahankara always changes, and you feel, "I am enjoying, I am experiencing, I am suffering." This doer is the samsari, which always suffers.
 -> Even after attaining enlightenment, the ego (a function of the mind) still exists. However, the enlightened being has realized with certainty that he is not the mind.

 -> In vedanta, anything you can experience is matter.
 
 -> Since we are born, we try to arrange everything to our satisfaction: first our toys, then people, then habits, then thoughts, etc. However, the whole project is sure to fail. Remember     that nature is subject to change. Whatever you have arranged to your satisfaction will change.

        "All compounded things decay." - Buddha

 -> When you realize that you are a witness to the ego, you know the whole story. The body and mind will still be there with all their problems, but you will no longer have one major     problem – they are no longer yours.


Verse 28:
 -> The constituents of nature (gunas in the form of senses and mind) are interacting with the constituents of nature (objects of perception). 
 -> Madhusūdana Sarasvatī comments on "Gunakarmavibhagaya" - here, vibhaga means that which is different from both gunas and karma, and that is the witness consciousness.


Verse 29:
  
  (Swami Sarvapriyananda: )

 -> Shri Krishna is asking enlightened beings or highly spiritual people not to confuse those who are ignorant. Instead, give them an upward push towards their spiritual progress.

 (Swami Shri Adgadanand Ji: )
  
  -> Saare Karm prakriti ki den hai. Karmyogi ko gunas and karm mai nhi ulajhna hai. Usse toh bas samarpan ke saath karm karte rehna hai.


Verse 30:
 -> If I am not yet enlightened and still feel that I am this body and mind, what should I do? 
      
     - Shri Krishna asks us to dedicate "all actions" to Him (Ishwara or Chaitanya) without any desire of our own. Make your actions a service to God or worship of God, not for your own            personal pleasure or satisfaction. Without any concern or anxiety or possessiveness.
     - Everything belongs to God.
     - "Yudhwāsa vigatajwara" can be understood as "engage in battle (or perform your duties) free from anxiety or feverishness."

Verse 32:
 -> Those who do not follow the teachings of Shri Krishna become deluded in matters of both knowledge—Parāvidyā (higher, spiritual knowledge) and Aparāvidyā (lower, material knowledge).         Such people not only get confused about the distinction between Māyā and Brahman, and the difference between Ātman (the true self) and Anātman (the non-self), but in practical terms,        they are also deluded about Dharma (righteousness) and Adharma (unrighteousness) because they are driven by their likes and dislikes.


Verse 33:
 -> Even the wise man acts according to the tendencies of his own nature.
 -> You can observe differences in the lives of enlightened or highly spiritual beings, as they too have their own swabhava.
 -> The whole point of spirituality is to make the mind sattvic so that one can easily transcend the three gunas to realize the absolute reality (Chaitanya), which is free from all gunas.
    Polishing the mirror till you see your real self clearly. 

Verse 34:
 -> All beings act according to their prakriti, but we must ensure that whatever arises from our prakriti is beneficial for our spiritual journey. If it is not beneficial for our 
    spiritual journey, then replace it with something else.

Verse 35:
  
  (Swami Sarvapriyananda):
    
    -> See this matrix:
                                Dharma                         |                 Adharma

                   Prakriti     This is swadharma and                            Avoid this
                                Krishna recommends this           

               Not Prakriti     You will fail if you try this                    Avoid this

    -> In traditional Vedic society, it was relatively easy to define Swadharma.
         
         It comprised five components:

           1. Sadharana Dharma - general ethics
           2. Varna Dharma
           3. Ashrama Dharma - the four stages of life
           4. Varnashrama Dharma - the combination of Varna and Ashrama Dharma
           5. Asadharana Dharma - unique duties that one has accepted, such as Arjuna's role as a commander or a doctor's responsibilities during surgery

    -> Today, the traditional varna system is considered irrelevant. The principle is: that which leads me to God is my Swadharma, and that which does not lead me towards God is not my             Swadharma.

    -> Swami Vivekananda said "Follow your own highest ideal". 
       
   

  (Swami Chinmayananda):

    -> The absolute dharma is Brahman, but each person has their own tendencies or vasanas, and hence their own Swadharma. The goal is to follow your own Swadharma and exhaust your vasanas.     -> You shouldn't try to imitate others or acquire their vasanas. If you are not Sattvik but Rajasik, then you should act according to that nature and strive to exhaust your tendencies.      -> Your own Swadharma, even if imperfect, is still better than someone else's dharma.

  (Acharya Prashant):
    
           ->  स्वधर्म वह है जो आत्मा से उठा हो, किसी और से नहीं।  जो एकदम तुम्हारा है, मौलिक है।  श्री कृष्ण कह रहे हैं, उस धर्म पर चलते हुए निधन भी श्रेयस्कर है।   अपने समझ से उठा धर्म।   जिसका संबंध तुम्हारे ज्ञान से, किताबों से न हो, परंपरा से न हो, जिसका संबंध तुम्हारे बोध से, प्रेम से हो।
       Swadharma is that which arises from the soul, not from anyone else. It is completely yours, original. Shri Krishna says, even death while following that dharma is auspicious. Dharma        that arises from your own understanding. That which is not connected to your knowledge, not books, not connected to your tradition, but that which is connected to your awareness,            your love.



Verse 37:
   -> Desire that arises from the Rajas guna is the enemy that must be conquered.
   -> The Rajas guna represents passion, activity, and desire. When Rajas dominates, it gives rise to intense cravings and attachment. This insatiable desire is often manifested as anger or       wrath when it is not fulfilled. Blinded by Rajasic desire, one will do anything to satisfy one's cravings, even if it hurts others in the process.
   -> Desire born of Rajas is the greatest enemy on the spiritual path.

   -> Desires are essentially our attempts to find joy in the limited. We try to become infinite by adding to the finite.
   -> Loving everyone equally is fine, but loving only those in your relationship is essentially a selfish desire because it caters to your body and mind. Love should be guided by Dharma,         not the other way around.


Verse 39:
   -> Desire is the enemy of the wise, not the fool, because the fool considers desire to be his friend.
   -> For a Gyani knows that desire unfulfilled will lead to frustration, while desire fulfilled will lead to dissatisfaction.


Verse 40:
  -> We think that desire is something in our mind but Krishna says that desire pervades all of our senses, mind, and intellect.


Verse 41:

   (Swami Sarvapriyananda)
 
  -> Jnana - knowledge of the Absolute or Nirguna Brahma
     Vijnana - knowledge of the Sakara Brahma or manifest Divinity
  -> At the start of our spiritual life, we must put a fence around ourselves, just as a young sapling is protected by a fence. The practice of controlling the senses is essential.

  (Swami Shri Adgadanand Ji)

  -> It is really difficult to grasp desires directly; that's why we must first examine the senses. But is it possible to control the senses? Shri Krishna answers this in the next verse

  


Verse 42:
  -> The subtle body is often described in terms of several layers or sheaths, known as "koshas" in Sanskrit. The most commonly mentioned koshas are:

     1.Annamaya Kosha (Physical Sheath): This is the physical body, which is composed of the elements of food. It is the gross, material aspect of the human being.

     2.Pranamaya Kosha (Vital Energy Sheath): This sheath is associated with the life force or prana, which is the vital energy that sustains the body. It includes the breath and the various energy channels (nadis) through which prana flows. (all physiological processes)

     3.Manomaya Kosha (Mental Sheath): This sheath is related to the mind and emotions. It encompasses thoughts, feelings, and mental processes.

     4.Vijnanamaya Kosha (Intellectual Sheath): This sheath is associated with intellect, wisdom, and discernment. It is linked to higher cognitive functions and understanding.

     5.Anandamaya Kosha (Bliss Sheath): This sheath is considered the innermost layer and is associated with a sense of bliss, joy, and spiritual awareness. It is often seen as the connection to the divine or the ultimate reality.

  Katha Upanishad Verse 2.3.7:
      Beyond the senses is the mind; higher than the mind is the intellect; above the intellect is the great atman; higher than the mahat is Avyaktam.

  Shankara’s Commentary:
    —As the senses have been stated to be distinct from the atman, he cannot be externally perceived; because he is the internal principle of all.
     How it is so, is explained. Beyond the senses, is the mind, etc., As arthas (rudiments) here are of the same class with the senses, they are included in the word Indriya. 
     The rest as previously explained. The word saiva here denotes ‘intellect.’


Verse 43:
  -> Whether it is Karma Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, Jnana Yoga, or Raja Yoga, desire is the prime enemy that one needs to overcome.

  -> The Chariot Analogy (Katha Upanishad Verse 1.3.4):
     
     - The chariot represents the body. It is the physical vessel that carries us through life. 
     - The horses symbolize the senses (sight, hearing, touch, taste, smell). Just as horses pull the chariot, our senses drive our experiences and perceptions of the world. They can be wild and impulsive, often leading us to chase after fleeting pleasures or distractions.
     - The reins are akin to the mind. The mind controls the senses, guiding them in a particular direction. If the mind is not disciplined, it can lead to erratic behavior, much like a charioteer who cannot control his horses.
     - The charioteer represents the intellect. The intellect has the role of mastering the mind and ensuring that it directs the senses appropriately. A wise charioteer knows when to pull back on the reins and when to let the horses run free, reflecting how an individual should use their intellect to regulate their thoughts and desires.
     - Finally, the passenger in the chariot symbolizes the self (Atman). The Atman is free from all external influences and is unaffected by the chaos of the senses or the mind. It is the true essence of who we are—eternal and unchanging.

     Shankara’s Commentary:
         —Those who are versed in the construction of chariots call the senses, such as the eye and the rest, horses, from the similitude of their drawing the body. 
          Know the objects (such as form, etc.), of these senses, regarded as horses, to be the roads. The intelligent call the atman combined with the body, 
          the senses and the mind, the enjoyer, i.e., one in Samsara; for, the pure atman cannot be the enjoyer. Its enjoyment is only the product of its conditions such as intelligence, etc.; 
          accordingly also, other srutis declare that the pure atman is certainly not the enjoyer. ‘It seems to think and to move’; only if this is so, in working out the analogy of the chariot to be described, it will be appropriate to understand. 
          ‘The Vishnu Pada’ as the pure atman but not otherwise; for, there can be no going beyond Samsara in the case of the pure atman.
