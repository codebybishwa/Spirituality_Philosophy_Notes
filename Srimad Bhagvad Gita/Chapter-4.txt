[The note contains commentary by Swami Sarvapriyananda (and the commentaries he used such as those of Madhusūdana Sarasvatī), Swami Shri Adgadanand Ji, and other sources like Acharya  Prashant] (If not mentioned explicitly, then the note is taken from Swami Sarvapriyananda's lectures)


Verse-01:

   -> The immortal Yoga (knowledge) is praised over here.
   -> Manu is considered as the origin/creator of human race.
   -> Similar statment is there in Mundaka upanisad.

   Ramsukhdasji points:
   -> Our relationship with God is eternal. We don't have to do anything to establish this relationship. We have forgotten this because we are engrossed in the non-eternal.
   -> Look at the Sun; it shines continuously and gives light and heat to the world selflessly. The light that the Sun shines on the world is completely detached from what it illuminates.       It is not affected by the objects it shines upon. The Sun serves as a great model for a Karma Yogi.
