Verse-01:

   -> The immortal Yoga (knowledge) is praised over here.
   -> Manu is considered as the origin/creator of human race.
   -> Similar statment is there in Mundaka upanisad.

   Ramsukhdasji points:
   -> Our relationship with God is eternal. We don't have to do anything to establish this relationship. We have forgotten this because we are engrossed in the non-eternal.
   -> Look at the Sun; it shines continuously and gives light and heat to the world selflessly. The light that the Sun shines on the world is completely detached from what it illuminates. 
      It is not affected by the objects it shines upon. The Sun serves as a great model for a Karma Yogi.
   -> Neither seek nor avoid. Do your best in accordance with the situation for the greater good. This is Karmayoga.

Verse-02:

   -> Over time, the transmission of knowledge weakens, and religion fades. Human tendencies like greed, lust, anger, and envy dominate, overshadowing the spiritual essence.


Verse-04:
  
  -> Across various religions, there is a belief in a unique, extraordinary person. For example, Avatars in Hinduism, Buddha in Buddhism, prophets in Judaism, Prophet Muhammad in Islam, 
     Jesus as the Son of God in Christianity, Tirthankars in Jainism, and Gurus in Sikhism. The birth and death of these figures are considered special. Ordinary human beings are born and 
     reborn because of their karma, which arises from desire, and that desire stems from ignorance of their true nature. God, however, has no ignorance. 
     Therefore, when the Lord appears as an incarnation, it is through knowledge, freedom, and compassion, and for the greater good of all conscious beings.
     Another key difference is that the individual soul (Jiva) is always in bondage until it attains liberation, while Avatars have no such bondage.

  -> The theory of Avatar suggests that Maya itself produces the body of the Avatar.

  -> In Advaita Vedanta, there is one absolute reality that appears in three forms: God (Saguna Brahman), the Individual (Jiva), and the Universe (Jagat), yet they are ultimately the same.


Verse-05:

   (Swami Chinmayananda)

  -> As water in the form of rain falls from the clouds, it is pure and clear. After passing through many stages in the river—through mountains, valleys, plains, forests, and so on — it accumulates various substances. 
     However, these are not part of the true chemical composition of water, but rather a mixture of external elements. Similarly, we and the Lord originate from the same source. 
    Over the course of many lives, we have accumulated karma and ignorance. We are pure consciousness, along with all these accumulated karmic results and ignorance.

  (One addition as per my understanding)

  ->  We can also take another insight from this verse by understanding that there have always been individuals like Arjuna who have faced terrible dilemmas in life and sought the truth,       
      needing to realize it. Shri Krishna is always there to guide such Arjunas, regardless of time and place.

Verse-06:

  -> In Vaishnava Vedanta, it is said that each aspect of "Sat-Chit-Ananda" (Existence-Consciousness-Bliss) has its own corresponding power. 
     "Sat" (existence) is associated with Sandhini Shakti, the power to bring things into existence."Chit" (consciousness) is linked to Samvit Shakti, the power to know everything. 
     "Ananda" (bliss) is connected to Hladini Shakti, the power of divine bliss. This power of divine bliss manifests as Sita, Radha, Mary, Sarada — the Shakti, or bliss, of God. 
      Avatars use Kripa Shakti, the power of grace, to incarnate and  bless the earth.

  -> There are two channels through which grace operates.For those who are jnanis (seekers of knowledge) and follow the path of knowledge, 
     this grace manifests as a tremendous inquiry— Brahma Jigyasa—the intense desire to know Brahman. They will not rest until they have realized Brahman. 

     For devotees, this grace manifests in the form of restlessness or vyakulata, a deep yearning to seek God. This divine discontentment brings one closer to God and cultivates tremendous love for Him.

  -> Even enlightenment was possible due to the grace of the Lord.


Verse-07, 08
  
    (Swami Shri Adgadanand Ji)
  
      -> जब 'अनुरागी' (साधक) धर्म के मार्ग पर आगे नहीं बढ़ पाता, उसकी यात्रा में कई अधार्मिक तत्व आ जाते हैं, तब-तब श्रीकृष्ण प्रकट होते हैं साधक की सहायता के लिए।
         When 'Anuragi' (the seeker) cannot progress on the path of dharma, and many unrighteous elements enter his journey, at such times, Shri Krishna manifests to help the seeker.

     -> युग का अर्थ सिर्फ सत्ययुग, त्रेता या द्वापर नहीं है। युग धर्म का उतार-चढ़ाव मानव के स्वभाव पर निर्भर करता है। युग धर्म सभी के हृदय में होता है। सभी युग तुम्हारे हृदय में ही समाहित हैं।
        The meaning of "Yug" is not limited to Satya Yug, Treta, or Dwapar. Yug is the rise and fall of dharma based on human nature. The essence of Yug Dharma resides in everyone's heart. 
        All the Yugas are contained within your heart.


Verse-09:

  -> Self-realization is God-realization. You ask two questions: first, "Who or what is the subject? Who am I?" The answer will lead you to self-realization. 
     The second question is, "What is the reality behind all of this — the reality behind the objective universe?" The answer is God. Advaita Vedanta teaches that 
     God and your true Self are the same — tat tvam asi ("That thou art"). This is the absolute convergence of Brahman and Atman.

(Swami Shri Adgadanand Ji)

    -> आत्मा ही परम तत्व है। अधिकांश लोग इस श्लोक को सुनकर कल्पना में खो जाते हैं और आकाश में उसका निवास ढूँढने लगते हैं। श्रीकृष्ण का उद्देश्य यह था कि यदि कोई निर्धारित कर्म करे, तो वह अनुभव करेगा कि वह भी दिव्य है। 
       श्रीकृष्ण स्वयं आपकी ही संभावना हैं। श्रीकृष्ण का स्वरूप आपके ही स्वरूप में निहित है। अवतार कहीं बाहर नहीं है। किंतु यदि हृदय अनुराग से पूर्ण हो, तो हृदय में ही अवतार के दर्शन हो जाते हैं।

   The soul itself is the supreme essence. Upon hearing this verse, most people start to imagine and seek Lord's abode in the sky. 
   Shri Krishna’s intent was that if one performs prescribed actions, they will realize their own divinity. Shri Krishna exists as a potential within you.
   Shri Krishna's form is mirrored in your own form. The avatar is not somewhere outside; rather, if the heart is filled with devotion, one can behold the avatar within their own heart.


Verse-10:

 -> Krishna inspires all seekers of God and spiritual aspirants. When we immerse ourselves in God and take refuge in Him, we become one with God by His grace, as many have done in the past.
    Through God's grace, wisdom arises that removes all attachment, fear, and anger.


Verse-11:

    (Swami Sarvapriyananda)

  -> The Lord grants us whatever we desire. Most people seek fulfillment of their worldly goals through God, while only highly spiritual individuals seek God alone. 

  -> There are two kinds of religious approaches: the lower form, in which one desires "God for my life," and the higher form, in which one dedicates "my life for God."


   (Swami Vivekanada)
   
   -> " In life, with all its miseries and sorrows, its joys and smiles and tears, one thing is certain, that all things are rushing towards their goal, and it is only a question of time 
      when you and I, and plants and animals, and every particles of life that exists must reach the Infinite Ocean of Perfection, must attain to Freedom, to God"
 
   -> Each individual is striving to attain God; it's just that the majority of humanity is doing so unconsciously. Only a few do it consciously.


Verse-12:

   (Swami Sarvapriyananda)

 -> People worship various 'gods' (lesser forms of the Supreme Lord) to receive the fruits of their actions. For instance, in Vedic times, people would worship the rain god to bring rain.     
    These lesser deities can fulfill many desires but cannot grant Moksha. Only the Supreme Lord (God) can grant Moksha.

 -> Note that "lesser gods" does not imply they are any less divine; they are forms of the Supreme Lord. They cannot grant Moksha simply because most people do not seek Moksha from them.
    In this human world, rituals and the worship of gods can indeed bring immediate results, which is what most people seek.

 -> Here, it can also mean that people worship their own "gods," such as money, fame, sensory pleasures, and so on, which may provide immediate results but never bring lasting satisfaction.

   
   (Swami Vivekananda)
   [ Taken from The Complete book of Yoga, chapter: MAYA AND THE EVOLUTION OF THE CONCEPTION OF GOD]

    -> " The idea that we form of God is a mere manifestation, our own creation. Behind that is the real God who never changes, the ever pure, the immutable. But the manifestation is always 
         changing revealing the reality behind more and more. When it reveals more of the fact behind, it is called 'progression', when it hides more of the fact behind, it is called retrogression. "

    -> " The primitve man was a man of impulse. He did what occured to him, and tried to bring out through his muscles whatever thought came into his mind, and he never stopped to judge, 
          and seldom tried to check his impulses. SO with the gods, they were also creatures of impulse "


Verse-13:

 -> Shri Krishna says that although he is the doer of all actions in the universe, he asks us not to consider him as the doer. 
    This indicates that Shri Krishna is none other than the sakshi chaitanya — the pure witness consciousness — that is never the doer of any action.

 -> The four orders of society (Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya, and Shudra) are determined based on Gunas — Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas — rather than on the basis of birth. Duties are assigned according to the Gunas. 
    If you currently have a Sattvic nature, you are considered a Brahmana; if Rajas dominates, you are dynamic and can be a Kshatriya. A Vaishya is characterized by Rajas, but when Tamas dominates, it overshadows Sattva. 
    In Shudras, Tamas dominates everything.

    It is important to note that these personalities are not permanent labels; they vary based on your currently predominant Guna. Birth has very little significance in this context. 
    Shri Krishna never endorses the traditional Indian caste system, which confines a person to a particular caste based solely on birth. Anyone who is an intellectual and seeks to impart knowledge to others as a teacher is a Brahmana. 
    Anyone who protects others with strength is a Kshatriya. Furthermore, these personalities can be found everywhere, irrespective of society, religion, or nation.


Verse-14:

 -> Shri Krishna is not merely a human being; he is the boundless existence, the witness consciousness that observes every action yet remains unaffected by any of them. 
    This unlimited being gives existence to all limited beings. He is like the screen on which the movie of these limited beings plays out. The movie does not affect the screen. 
    In one sense, the screen is the doer of all actions in the movie—there would be no movie without the screen—yet the screen remains unaffected by it. 
    Shri Krishna is "sat," the ultimate reality, and all existing things are simply appearances within him.


Verse-18 (one of the most important verse in the entire Bhagavad Gita)

  Do watch this video by Swami Sarvapriyananda - The language of Paradox: https://youtu.be/eiP5OAvkNFc?si=ogXYJfYOGewl5pDq

 -> Shankaracharya explains that when we cross a river in a boat, the trees on the banks appear to move. This illusion occurs not because the trees are moving, but due to the movement of        the boat superimposing on the stationary landscape. Similarly, our bodily functions, thoughts, and physiological processes are superimposed as actions on the unchanging Atman. Thus, the     apparent activity is merely a projection over the eternal and immutable self.

 -> Swami Vivekananda says " The ideal of Vedanta is eternal peace in the midst of intense action " He gives example of Bhagavad Gita. In the midst of terrible war, there is a beautiful         smile in the face of Krishna.

 -> People believe the mind should be calm, but you have identified yourself with the mind. You think that when the mind is calm, you are calm. Instead, let the mind do its work.

 -> Krishna says that a wise person understands that even amidst apparent action, one remains completely unaffected by it.

 -> The language of paradox helps us understand what we truly are. When we say "God is within us," what do we really mean? Is God in our organs or mind?
    Vedanta teaches that whatever does not stay with you when you enter deep sleep does not belong to you. Your friends, your enemies, your diseases, your desires, and your thoughts do not      accompany you, so they do not belong to you. However, there is an infinite consciousness shining in that state, which you are unaware of because that awareness is you.

    
    Meaning of the verse:

 -> There is no action in the self. All action occurs in the "not-self." Pure consciousness is not engaged in action. All actions are carried out by the body-mind complex within the world.
    When we speak of action, it is the ego (Aham), an activity of the mind, that—surrounded by the body and the mind—perceives itself as the doer of all actions. When the body walks, the        ego claims, "I walk." When thoughts arise, the ego says, "I understand." Conversely, when the mind is calm, the ego declares, "I do not think; I have calmed the mind." All of this is        merely the activity of the ego, which persistently claims doership.

 -> All of Arjuna's activities — whether he chooses to fight the battle or abstain from it—are not truly his own. He is, in essence, merely the witness (Sakshi) of all that unfolds. 

 -> All the activities of Arjuna—whether he chooses to fight the battle or not—are not truly his activities. He is, in reality, just the witness of them all. 

 -> Krishna tells us to recognize that, in the midst of all actions, there is no real action happening. However, there is no need to stop the actions. It is the very nature of prakriti to       make the body and mind work.What you perceive as "no activity" is merely the rest of the body and mind, including sleeping, meditating, or fasting.
