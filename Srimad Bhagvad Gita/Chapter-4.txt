Verse-01:

   -> The immortal Yoga (knowledge) is praised over here.
   -> Manu is considered as the origin/creator of human race.
   -> Similar statment is there in Mundaka upanisad.

   Ramsukhdasji points:
   -> Our relationship with God is eternal. We don't have to do anything to establish this relationship. We have forgotten this because we are engrossed in the non-eternal.
   -> Look at the Sun; it shines continuously and gives light and heat to the world selflessly. The light that the Sun shines on the world is completely detached from what it illuminates. 
      It is not affected by the objects it shines upon. The Sun serves as a great model for a Karma Yogi.
   -> Neither seek nor avoid. Do your best in accordance with the situation for the greater good. This is Karmayoga.

Verse-02:

   -> Over time, the transmission of knowledge weakens, and religion fades. Human tendencies like greed, lust, anger, and envy dominate, overshadowing the spiritual essence.


Verse-04:
  
  -> Across various religions, there is a belief in a unique, extraordinary person. For example, Avatars in Hinduism, Buddha in Buddhism, prophets in Judaism, Prophet Muhammad in Islam, 
     Jesus as the Son of God in Christianity, Tirthankars in Jainism, and Gurus in Sikhism. The birth and death of these figures are considered special. Ordinary human beings are born and 
     reborn because of their karma, which arises from desire, and that desire stems from ignorance of their true nature. God, however, has no ignorance. 
     Therefore, when the Lord appears as an incarnation, it is through knowledge, freedom, and compassion, and for the greater good of all conscious beings.
     Another key difference is that the individual soul (Jiva) is always in bondage until it attains liberation, while Avatars have no such bondage.

  -> The theory of Avatar suggests that Maya itself produces the body of the Avatar.

  -> In Advaita Vedanta, there is one absolute reality that appears in three forms: God (Saguna Brahman), the Individual (Jiva), and the Universe (Jagat), yet they are ultimately the same.


Verse-05:

   (Swami Chinmayananda)

  -> As water in the form of rain falls from the clouds, it is pure and clear. After passing through many stages in the river—through mountains, valleys, plains, forests, and so on — it accumulates various substances. 
     However, these are not part of the true chemical composition of water, but rather a mixture of external elements. Similarly, we and the Lord originate from the same source. 
    Over the course of many lives, we have accumulated karma and ignorance. We are pure consciousness, along with all these accumulated karmic results and ignorance.

  (One addition as per my understanding)

  ->  We can also take another insight from this verse by understanding that there have always been individuals like Arjuna who have faced terrible dilemmas in life and sought the truth,       
      needing to realize it. Shri Krishna is always there to guide such Arjunas, regardless of time and place.

Verse-06:

  -> In Vaishnava Vedanta, it is said that each aspect of "Sat-Chit-Ananda" (Existence-Consciousness-Bliss) has its own corresponding power. 
     "Sat" (existence) is associated with Sandhini Shakti, the power to bring things into existence."Chit" (consciousness) is linked to Samvit Shakti, the power to know everything. 
     "Ananda" (bliss) is connected to Hladini Shakti, the power of divine bliss. This power of divine bliss manifests as Sita, Radha, Mary, Sarada — the Shakti, or bliss, of God. 
      Avatars use Kripa Shakti, the power of grace, to incarnate and  bless the earth.

  -> There are two channels through which grace operates.For those who are jnanis (seekers of knowledge) and follow the path of knowledge, 
     this grace manifests as a tremendous inquiry— Brahma Jigyasa—the intense desire to know Brahman. They will not rest until they have realized Brahman. 

     For devotees, this grace manifests in the form of restlessness or vyakulata, a deep yearning to seek God. This divine discontentment brings one closer to God and cultivates tremendous love for Him.

  -> Even enlightenment was possible due to the grace of the Lord.


Verse-09:

  -> Self-realization is God-realization. You ask two questions: first, "Who or what is the subject? Who am I?" The answer will lead you to self-realization. 
     The second question is, "What is the reality behind all of this — the reality behind the objective universe?" The answer is God. Advaita Vedanta teaches that 
     God and your true Self are the same — tat tvam asi ("That thou art"). This is the absolute convergence of Brahman and Atman.


Verse-10:

 -> Krishna inspires all seekers of God and spiritual aspirants. When we immerse ourselves in God and take refuge in Him, we become one with God by His grace, as many have done in the past.
    Through God's grace, wisdom arises that removes all attachment, fear, and anger.
