Chapter-4: The Yoga of Knowledge as well as the Disciplines of Action and Knowledge

[The note contains commentary by Swami Sarvapriyananda (and the commentaries he used such as those of Madhusūdana Sarasvatī), Swami Shri Adgadanand Ji, and other sources like Acharya  Prashant] (If not mentioned explicitly, then the note is taken from Swami Sarvapriyananda's lectures)


Verse-01:

   -> The immortal Yoga (knowledge) is praised over here.
   -> Manu is considered as the origin/creator of human race.
   -> Similar statment is there in Mundaka upanisad.

   Ramsukhdasji points:
   -> Our relationship with God is eternal. We don't have to do anything to establish this relationship. We have forgotten this because we are engrossed in the non-eternal.
   -> Look at the Sun; it shines continuously and gives light and heat to the world selflessly. The light that the Sun shines on the world is completely detached from what it illuminates. 
      It is not affected by the objects it shines upon. The Sun serves as a great model for a Karma Yogi.
   -> Neither seek nor avoid. Do your best in accordance with the situation for the greater good. This is Karmayoga.

Verse-02:

   -> Over time, the transmission of knowledge weakens, and religion fades. Human tendencies like greed, lust, anger, and envy dominate, overshadowing the spiritual essence.


Verse-04:
  
  -> Across various religions, there is a belief in a unique, extraordinary person. For example, Avatars in Hinduism, Buddha in Buddhism, prophets in Judaism, Prophet Muhammad in Islam, 
     Jesus as the Son of God in Christianity, Tirthankars in Jainism, and Gurus in Sikhism. The birth and death of these figures are considered special. Ordinary human beings are born and 
     reborn because of their karma, which arises from desire, and that desire stems from ignorance of their true nature. God, however, has no ignorance. 
     Therefore, when the Lord appears as an incarnation, it is through knowledge, freedom, and compassion, and for the greater good of all conscious beings.
     Another key difference is that the individual soul (Jiva) is always in bondage until it attains liberation, while Avatars have no such bondage.

  -> The theory of Avatar suggests that Maya itself produces the body of the Avatar.
