Chapter-4: The Yoga of Knowledge as well as the Disciplines of Action and Knowledge

[The note contains commentary by Swami Sarvapriyananda (and the commentaries he used such as those of Madhusūdana Sarasvatī), Swami Shri Adgadanand Ji, Swami Chinmayananda and Acharya Prashant ] (If not mentioned explicitly, then the note is taken from Swami Sarvapriyananda's lectures)


Verse-01:

   -> The immortal Yoga (knowledge) is praised over here.
   -> Manu is considered as the origin/creator of human race.
   -> Similar statment is there in Mundaka upanisad.

   Ramsukhdasji points:
   -> Our relationship with God is eternal. We don't have to do anything to establish this relationship. We have forgotten this because we are engrossed in the non-eternal.
   -> Look at the Sun; it shines continuously and gives light and heat to the world selflessly. The light that the Sun shines on the world is completely detached from what it illuminates. 
      It is not affected by the objects it shines upon. The Sun serves as a great model for a Karma Yogi.
   -> Neither seek nor avoid. Do your best in accordance with the situation for the greater good. This is Karmayoga.

Verse-02:

   -> Over time, the transmission of knowledge weakens, and religion fades. Human tendencies like greed, lust, anger, and envy dominate, overshadowing the spiritual essence.


Verse-04:
  
  -> Across various religions, there is a belief in a unique, extraordinary person. For example, Avatars in Hinduism, Buddha in Buddhism, prophets in Judaism, Prophet Muhammad in Islam, 
     Jesus as the Son of God in Christianity, Tirthankars in Jainism, and Gurus in Sikhism. The birth and death of these figures are considered special. Ordinary human beings are born and 
     reborn because of their karma, which arises from desire, and that desire stems from ignorance of their true nature. God, however, has no ignorance. 
     Therefore, when the Lord appears as an incarnation, it is through knowledge, freedom, and compassion, and for the greater good of all conscious beings.
     Another key difference is that the individual soul (Jiva) is always in bondage until it attains liberation, while Avatars have no such bondage.

  -> The theory of Avatar suggests that Maya itself produces the body of the Avatar.


Verse-05:

   (Swami Chinmayananda)

  -> As water in the form of rain falls from the clouds, it is pure and clear. After passing through many stages in the river—through mountains, valleys, plains, forests, and so on — it accumulates various substances. 
     However, these are not part of the true chemical composition of water, but rather a mixture of external elements. Similarly, we and the Lord originate from the same source. 
    Over the course of many lives, we have accumulated karma and ignorance. We are pure consciousness, along with all these accumulated karmic results and ignorance.

  (One addition as per my understanding)

  ->  We can also take another insight from this verse by understanding that there have always been individuals like Arjuna who have faced terrible dilemmas in life and sought the truth,       
      needing to realize it. Shri Krishna is always there to guide such Arjunas, regardless of time and place.
